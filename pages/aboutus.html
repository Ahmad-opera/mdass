            <p class="mb-10">

            <h1 class="text-2xl py-1 block font-semibold">Philosophy</h1>


            <p class="mb-10">
                Staff members of Madrasatu Dhiyau’ddinil Islam embrace the philosophy that every student is equal, unique, capable, and worthy of the best education possible. The future of the Muslim community depends upon an educated and responsible Ummah (community) that is grounded in Islamic tenets and principles. Islam encourages all Muslims to acquire knowledge throughout their life. Allah elevates those who have knowledge over those who are lacking. Allah says in the holy Quran:
                <tt class="font-semibold">"Allah  exalts in degree those of you who believe and who have been granted knowledge and Allah is aware of what you do." (Al-Quran 58:11), </tt> Also, as narrated by Abdullah bin Mas'oud (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Do not wish to be like anyone except in two cases. The first is a person whom Allah has given wealth, and he spends it righteously.  The second is to whom Allah has given wisdom, and he acts according to it and teaches it to others”.
                <br>
                Thus, Madrasatu Dhiyau’ddinil Islam is dedicated to providing conducive learning environment and academic preparation of Muslim youth under Islamic atmosphere to compete for success in this fast-changing life and hereafter.
